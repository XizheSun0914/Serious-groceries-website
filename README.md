# Serious-groceries-website
Serious Groceries is a website that is intended to assist users on deciding what to make for their meals. It takes into 
account with both price and palate ensuring users have a cheap and tasty meal.
For the first part, I made pie graphs that represented different diets for different individuals(carbs, protien, fat 
proportions). This data was taken off a website that was found to have straight forward data.
Second, I implemented a bar graph indicating the prices of general produce in the surrounding area(Victoria). This gives users
an idea of a price to look back on and use as a standard. I implemented the open source char.js and Semantics UI's built in
JavaScript moduels. 
Last, I implemented a map that could indicate the locations of surrounding groceries store. I used Google Maps' API.
